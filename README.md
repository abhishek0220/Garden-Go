Remember the craze, when the Pokemon Go first launched for our mobiles. We spend our days all around catching pokemons and earning points. Keeping the craze alive we launch our all new Garden-Go where instead of catching pokemons we need to capture new plant species. The more you discover the more points you get. Let the plant catching begins!! .


## Features

- **PLantation Drive:** Capture yourself with the plant you have just captured and get points based on species and whether you have discovered a new species or not, it has an integrated face authentication that authenticates your face as well.

- **Species recognition:** Not sure whats the plant, species name you have just captured no worries check it on our app

- **RecycleTeller:** Came across some garbage while on your little discover tour and cannot identify whether this garbage comes under recyclable or non-recyclable check it here and extend your little help in saving the environment
